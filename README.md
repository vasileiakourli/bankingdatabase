Info: Using MySQL, This project consists of 2 phases and aims to create a database of banking data. 
After finding out what is the efficient form of the base (BCNF), there is phase 1, making the tables and adding the datasetA to them.
At the end of the phase 1, there are some questions to check the results of the base.
In phase 2, additional data is added to the database, datasetB. Then, queries are found from the database and the results are recorded. 
This procedure is followed again  after the construction of indexes. At the end of phase 2, needed to compare the results to see the differences
